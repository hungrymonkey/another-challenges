# Challenge 1

This project is structure such that

```
src/ - contains all the source code
src/data_structures/ - contains most of the solution algorithm
src/App.js - is the homepage
src/App.test.js contains a few test to validate the result
README_EXPLANATION.md - contains majority of the technical information
```

For your convience, I create a Dockerfile and two scripts for the reactjs app

Depends: Docker
```
./build_docker.sh
./start_docker.sh
open localhost:3000 in the browser
```
