# Problem

Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the minimum difference between any two numbers in the array.
For example if the array is [ 5, 8, 2, 4 ] then the minimum difference would be 1 because array[0] = 5 and array[3] = 4 leading to 5 - 4 = 1.
Constraints:
You can only subtract from left to right (ex: you can't do 4 - 2 since that's going backwards but you can do 5 - 2).
You can't subtract a number from itself (ex: 5 - 5)
Result can't be negative (ex: 5 - 8)
